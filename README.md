## "Your journey to the Crumb Kingdom begins with a single slice..."

Welcome to **Crumb Chronicles**, where your career prospects depend entirely on impressing a kitchen appliance with an attitude. Originally developed as a text-based C++ adventure, this game has been reborn in the browser, bringing the toasty goodness to everyone with an internet connection!

## 🔥 What Is This Madness? 🔥

You, a humble "Crumb Aspirant," are being interviewed by a sentient toaster for a position in the prestigious Crumb Kingdom. Answer a series of increasingly absurd questions, discover hidden easter eggs, and unlock special endings that will leave you questioning your life choices.

Will you be crowned as the Senior Crumb Strategist? Banished to eternal Butter Duty? Or perhaps open a portal to the fabled Butter Realm? The choice is yours, but choose wisely – these toasters have a tendency to hold grudges.

## ✨ Features ✨

- **Witty Dialog**: Experience the dry humor of a kitchen appliance that takes itself far too seriously
- **Multiple Endings**: Your answers determine your fate in the Crumb Kingdom
- **Easter Eggs**: Discover hidden keywords to unlock secret endings
- **ASCII Art**: Because nothing says "sophisticated gaming experience" like text that vaguely resembles a toaster
- **Global Leaderboard**: See how your toaster-impressing skills rank against players worldwide
- **Achievements**: Unlock special achievements like "Golden Toast" and "Crust King"
- **Zero Carbs**: Play as much as you want without worrying about your bread intake

<details>
<summary>Need a hint?</summary>
Think of things you might put in, on, or around a toaster... or perhaps what a toaster might consider blasphemy.

## 💻 Technical Details 💻

This game was originally written in C++ and has been converted to:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Firebase Realtime Database (for the global leaderboard)

## 🧠 Behind the Toast 🧠

Crumb Chronicles began as a university project exploring text-based game design in C++. The web version preserves all the quirky charm of the original while making it accessible to a broader audience. The addition of a global leaderboard allows players worldwide to compete for toaster approval.

## 🔮 Future Upgrades 🔮

- Additional interview questions
- More secret endings
- Sound effects (wait until you hear a toaster's evil laugh)
- Timed mode (answer before you're burnt to a crisp)
- Multiplayer mode (because one sentient toaster wasn't terrifying enough)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments 🙏

- Special thanks to all the toasters who suffered through my burned bread experiments
- Inspiration drawn from every kitchen appliance that's ever looked at me judgmentally
- My university professor who probably didn't expect "sentient kitchen appliance simulator" as a project submission

Remember: In the Crumb Kingdom, it's always better to be toasted than to be burned. Good luck, Crumb Aspirant!
